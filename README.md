## SoftSysMotivatedMimosas

Our project is to create a program that replicates portions of [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/). GDB is a software program that allows developers to debug programs and give many pieces of useful information about the execution and state of the program.

### Compilation

`cd` into the `gdb-lite` directory and run the following make commands to compile or clean the project:

```bash
make package # Makes a gdb-lite executable in the gdb-lite directory
make clean # Removes temporary object files for a clean rebuild
```
